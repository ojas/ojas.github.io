> I have consistently preached that nonviolence demands that the means we use must be as pure as the ends we seek.

â€“ Martin Luther King Jr.

From the powerful Christmas 1957 sermon delivered at the Dexter Avenue Baptist Church in Montgomery, Alabama. The sermon was written while jailed for committing nonviolent civil disobedience during the Montgomery bus boycott.
