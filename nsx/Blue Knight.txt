i agree with all my fellow NSX members.....if you want something different (a badge perhaps) then get it. there's no reason to use the X as a means to justify your new purchase. 

if you like something, buy it. don't buy it because you want to think it's better than what you had. it'll become an endless pursuit that will get you nowhere......

in this round, you are the weakest link......goodbye!
