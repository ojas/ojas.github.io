I’m home in Austin, Texas until mid-August:

In a few weeks, I'm taking a roadtrip which marks some sort of new beginning.

I've enjoyed the last few weeks at TheSV

- Launching my new company, [Auto Dojo](https://auto-dojo.com/). We got our first legit customer last month.
- Growing my existing software company, [Sage IQ](http://sage-iq.com/). Current engagements:
	- Running software development for a local tech startup
	- Working with couple small-medium size businesses in Austin
- In the process of expanding Sage IQ to offering coworking spaces. 
- Leveling-up my vacation / short-term rental business
	- Operationalizing going well
	- Expanding to tiny home
- Loving the lifestyle changes
	- Moving out of [TheSV](http://airbnb.com/rooms/15392080) and into #Suite964.
	- #MonkLife
- Fleshing out several real-estate development ideas
