	This is my 1996 Mazda Miata.  I bought it in April 2007.
	I wanted a fun car I could drive daily and track without worries.  I totally enjoyed
	tracking my <a href="/nsx">NSXs</a>, but I think my current Zanardi #04 is too nice.
</p>
<p>
	Most of my friends recommended getting a Miata; although, one of them said "I have a solution...
	Just track your NSX and it won't be nice anymore". :-)
</p>
<p>
	I'd always appreciated Miatas and a black one is what I was after.  I'd planned to add
	chrome or stainless style bar, dark wheels, and a few other mods, so I think this was a good find
	since it came pre-modded. 
	Now, I just need to make it look like <a href="/miata-r">this</a>. 
</p>
<p>
	It has a few mods, here's a partial list:
</p>
<ul>
	<li>Jackson Racing cold air induction kit</li>
	<li>(unknown) style bar</li>
	<li>Chaparral S15 wheels (15x7"?) &amp; Kumho ECSTA SPT tires</li>
	<li>Tokico Illumina? shocks</li>
	<li>shiny fuel lid, shiny interior trim, shiny shift knob</li>
</ul>
